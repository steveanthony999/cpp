# C++ Elements (syntax)

### Keywords

A list of reserved keywords in C++. Since they are used by the language, keywords are not available for re-definition or overloading.

Some examples include: <ul><li>int</li> <li>double</li> <li>float</li> <li>char</li> <li>return</li> <li>if</li> <li>else</li></ul> The link below has a full list of reserved keywords.

### Identifiers

In addition to keywords, there are identifiers with special meaning, which may be used as names of objects or functions, but have special meaning in certain contexts.

Examples include: <ul><li>std</li> <li>cin</li> <li>cout</li> <li>endl</li></ul>

Identifiers were created by other programmers to create something meaningful.

The same link above shows some identifiers.

### Operators

Lke most programming languages, C++ includes the basic operators such as <ul><li>+</li> <li>-</li> <li>\*</li> and <li>/</li></ul> C++ also has it's own operators, such as <ul><li><<</li> <li>::</li> <li>>></li></ul>
