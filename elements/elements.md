# C++ Elements (syntax)

### Keywords

A list of reserved keywords in C++. Since they are used by the language, keywords are not available for re-definition or overloading.

Some examples include: <ul><li>int</li> <li>double</li> <li>float</li> <li>char</li> <li>return</li> <li>if</li> <li>else</li></ul> The link below has a full list of reserved keywords.

### Identifiers

In addition to keywords, there are identifiers with special meaning, which may be used as names of objects or functions, but have special meaning in certain contexts.

Examples include: <ul><li>std</li> <li>cin</li> <li>cout</li> <li>endl</li></ul>

Identifiers were created by other programmers to create something meaningful.

The same link above shows some identifiers.

### Operators

Lke most programming languages, C++ includes the basic operators such as <ul><li>+</li> <li>-</li> <li>\*</li> <li>/</li></ul> C++ also has it's own operators, such as <ul><li><<</li> <li>::</li> <li>>></li></ul>

### Preprocessor Directives

What is a preprocessor?

The C++ Preprocessor is a program that processes your source code before the compiler sees it. It first strips the comments from the source file and replaces each comment with a single space. Then it looks for preprocessor directives and executes them.

Preprocessor directives are lines in the source code that begin with #.

Some preprocessor directives are:

<ul>
<li>#include</li>
<li>#if</li>
<li>#elif</li>
<li>#else</li>
<li>#endif</li>
<li>#ifdef</li>
<li>#ifndef</li>
<li>#define</li>
<li>#undef</li>
<li>#line</li>
<li>#error</li>
<li>#pragma</li>
</ul>
