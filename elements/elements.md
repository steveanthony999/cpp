# C++ Elements (syntax)

A list of reserved keywords in C++. Since they are used by the language, keywords are not available for re-definition or overloading.

Some examples include: int, double, float, char, return, if, and else. The link below has a full list of reserved keywords.

### Identifiers

In addition to keywords, there are identifiers with special meaning, which may be used as names of objects or functions, but have special meaning in certain contexts.

Examples include: std, cin, cout, endl.

Identifiers were created by other programmers to create something meaningful.

The same link above shows some identifiers.

### Operators

Lke most programming languages, C++ includes the basic operators such as +, -, \*, and /. C++ also has it's own operators, such as <<, ::, >>.
